Pinniped allows you to plug external OpenID Connect (OIDC) or LDAP identity providers (IDP) into Tanzu Kubernetes clusters, so that you can control user access to those clusters.
You can enable identity management during or after management cluster deployment. Any workload clusters that you create after enabling identity management are automatically configured to use the same identity provider as the management cluster.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tap.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tap.html</guid><description>Tanzu Application Platform Deployment This deployment outlines the deployment steps for VMware Tanzu Application Platform 1.1 on a Kubernetes workload cluster. In accordance with the Tanzu Application Platform Reference Design, four clusters will be created:
Tanzu Application Platform Build Cluster Tanzu Application Platform Run Cluster Tanzu Application Platform View Cluster Tanzu Application Platform Iterate Cluster Prerequisites Before deploying VMware Tanzu Application Platform, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
A Tanzu Network account is available for downloading Tanzu Application Platform packages.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-data-protection.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-data-protection.html</guid><description>Enable Data Protection on a Workload Cluster and Configure Backup You can run backup and restore operations in Tanzu Mission Control to protect your Kubernetes data.
Prerequisites Before you enable Data Protection on a workload cluster, ensure the following prerequisites:
You have an active Tanzu Mission Control subscription.
The workload cluster that you want to protect is registered or attached with Tanzu Mission Control.
You have created a credential for Data Protection as per instructions provided in the Tanzu Mission Control documentation.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-nsxt-airgap.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-nsxt-airgap.html</guid><description>﻿# Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on vSphere with NSX-T Networking in Air-gapped Environment
VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) (multi-cloud) provides organizations with a consistent, upstream-compatible, regional Kubernetes substrate that is ready for end-user workloads and ecosystem integrations. It delivers an open source aligned Kubernetes distribution with consistent operations and management to support infrastructure and app modernization.
An air-gapped installation method is used when the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid components (bootstrapper and cluster nodes) are unable to connect to the Internet to download the installation binaries from the public VMware Registry during Tanzu Kubernetes Grid installation or upgrade.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-package-install.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-package-install.html</guid><description>Deploy User-Managed Packages in Workload Clusters After creating workload clusters, you can install user-managed packages. These packages extend the core functionality of the Kubernetes clusters created by Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.
For example, you can install the Contour package to implement ingress control, the Harbor package to configure a private container registry, or the Fluent Bit, Grafana, and Prometheus packages to collect logs and metrics from your clusters.
You can install Tanzu packages via the CLI by invoking the tanzu package install command or directly from Tanzu Mission Control by utilizing the TMC Catalog feature.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-vsphere-vds-airgap.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/deployment-guides-tkg-vsphere-vds-airgap.html</guid><description>﻿# Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on vSphere Networking in an Air-Gapped Environment
