Tanzu Kubernetes Grid implements user authentication with Pinniped, an open-source authentication service for Kubernetes clusters. Pinniped allows you to plug external OpenID Connect (OIDC) or LDAP identity providers (IdP) into Tanzu Kubernetes (workload) clusters so that you can control user access to those clusters.
For LDAP authentication, Pinniped uses Dex as the endpoint to connect to your upstream LDAP IdP. If you use OIDC, Pinniped provides its own endpoint, so Dex is not required.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-tkg-nsxt-airgap-ra.md.old.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-tkg-nsxt-airgap-ra.md.old.html</guid><description>﻿# Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on NSX-T Networking in Airgap Environment - Reference Design

However, do not feel constrained to follow this exact path if your specific use cases warrant a different architecture.
Design decisions enumerated in this document exemplify the main design issues you will encounter in planning your Tanzu Application Platform environment and the rationale behind a chosen solution path. Understanding these decisions can help provide a rationale for any necessary deviation from this architecture.</description></item><item><title>Architecture Overview</title><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-tkg-edge.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-tkg-edge.html</guid><description>Architecture Overview This solution architecture is intended for anyone responsible for designing, implementing, managing, and securing edge sites, including DevOps administrators, VI administrators, platform operators, and security teams.
Topology Multiple topologies are possible for edge deployments. Some of the topologies are described in this section. However, the VMware Tanzu Edge Solution Architecture uses a centralized or hub and spoke topology, where a vCenter is deployed at the main data center location and a vSphere cluster is deployed in the data center at each edge site.</description></item><item><title>Tanzu Application Platform 1.2 Planning and Architecture Reference</title><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-index-tap.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-index-tap.html</guid><description>Tanzu Application Platform 1.2 Planning and Architecture Reference Tanzu Application Platform Planning and Architecture Reference provides a standard architecture for deploying Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) 1.2.

Config maps, custom resource definitions, and secrets are all stored in the Kubernetes control plane. All of these are critical to your clusters’ operations. Protecting this data is just as critical as protecting any other element of your IT infrastructure, so it should be covered by data protection and your disaster recovery plan.</description></item><item><title>Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on vSphere Networking in an Air-Gapped Environment Reference Design</title><link>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-tkg-vsphere-vds-airgap.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://craigtracey.github.io/validated-solutions/reference-designs-tkg-vsphere-vds-airgap.html</guid><description>Tanzu Kubernetes Grid on vSphere Networking in an Air-Gapped Environment Reference Design VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (multi-cloud) provides organizations with a consistent, upstream-compatible, regional Kubernetes substrate that is ready for end-user workloads and ecosystem integrations.
